        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
        Throughout my coursework in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained invaluable experience in software development, problem-solving, and security-focused programming. My work demonstrates a keen attention to detail and a strong ability to analyze and enhance software systems. By refining my artifact, I have showcased proficiency in data structures and algorithms, software engineering principles, database management, and security best practices. <br>

From the outset of my academic journey, I was committed to becoming a software developer, and this program has reinforced that goal. However, one of the most significant takeaways from my coursework has been the emphasis on security. I now have a deeper appreciation for the complexities of integrating security measures into software and understand the necessity of designing applications with security in mind from the beginning. <br>

Enhancing my artifact has directly contributed to my professional development. This project not only demonstrates my ability to optimize and refactor code but also highlights my capacity to implement industry best practices. Additionally, presenting my work in a structured manner has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders and collaborate in a team environment—both crucial skills in the field of software development. <br>

The artifact I selected was originally my final project for CS300: Data Structures and was published on GitHub on December 16, 2023. It began as an implementation of a HashTable for efficient data insertion and retrieval. This project demonstrated foundational knowledge in data structures and efficient data lookup—critical skills for any software developer. <br>

To enhance the artifact, I made several key improvements: <br>
- Replacing the HashTable with a Red-Black Tree to improve search efficiency and ensure self-balancing properties. <br>
- Implementing dynamic unit tests to validate functionality and ensure code reliability. <br>
- MySQL integration will be added to support data persistence through importing and exporting data. <br>
These enhancements demonstrate my ability to optimize algorithm performance, improve software reliability through testing, and integrate database solutions—essential competencies in modern software development. This project serves as a testament to my ability to solve complex problems, adapt existing systems for efficiency, and deliver maintainable and scalable solutions. <br>

Through my coursework and hands-on experience, I have developed the technical and professional skills necessary for a successful career in software development. My ability to refine and optimize code, work collaboratively, and incorporate security-conscious design decisions positions me as a strong candidate for roles in the field. This ePortfolio is a reflection of my growth and a showcase of my ability to develop robust and efficient software solutions.
