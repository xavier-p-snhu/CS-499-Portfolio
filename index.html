        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
        Throughout my coursework in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained invaluable experience in software development, problem-solving, and security-focused programming. My work demonstrates a keen attention to detail and a strong ability to analyze and enhance software systems. By refining my artifact, I have showcased proficiency in data structures and algorithms, software engineering principles, database management, and security best practices. <br>

From the outset of my academic journey, I was committed to becoming a software developer, and this program has reinforced that goal. However, one of the most significant takeaways from my coursework has been the emphasis on security. I now have a deeper appreciation for the complexities of integrating security measures into software and understand the necessity of designing applications with security in mind from the beginning. <br>

Enhancing my artifact has directly contributed to my professional development. This project not only demonstrates my ability to optimize and refactor code but also highlights my capacity to implement industry best practices. Additionally, presenting my work in a structured manner has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders and collaborate in a team environmentâ€”both crucial skills in the field of software development. <br>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>This artifact is a final project I created for my CS300 (Data Structures) course at SNHU. It was published to GitHub on December 16, 2023, and demonstrates the insertion and retrieval of data from a HashTable. The project showcases foundational skills in data structures, such as efficient data storage and lookup, which are essential for software development. I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it effectively demonstrates my skills in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.</p>

            <h3>Data Structures: Red-Black Tree Implementation</h3>
            <p>This artifact is a final project I created for my CS300 (Data Structures) course at SNHU. It was published to GitHub on December 16, 2023, and demonstrates the insertion and retrieval of data from a HashTable.</p>
            <p><strong>Enhancements:</strong> Implemented Red-Black Tree, added deletion function, structured tests for validation.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Issues with modularizing code, debugging testing framework integration, handling memory management.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="databases">
            <h3>Databases: MySQL Integration</h3>
            <p>During my enhancements, I incorporated MySQL for persistent data storage. I faced challenges in linking the necessary .dll files in Visual Studio but ultimately solved it by ensuring architecture compatibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Enhancements:</strong> Implemented SQL database storage, improved data retrieval efficiency, reinforced knowledge of SQL commands.</p>
